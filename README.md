https://huggingface.co/nenad1002/Llama-3.1-8B-resort_bot_model

This is a fine tuned model that can be utilized to ask questions about the resort which is described here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nenad1002/resort-bot-dataset

The model is based of Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, so you can reuse the tokenizer and chat template that you would otherwise use for Llama 3.1.
